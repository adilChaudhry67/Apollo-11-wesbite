			<h3>Neil Armstrong's Spacesuit</h3>
			<h2>What you should know</h2>			
			<p>The Apollo lunar spacesuits, also known as A-7L, were designed with several vital functions to safeguard astronauts during extravehicular activities and unpressurized spacecraft operations [1, 2].
			<br>
			<br>


				<h2>Protection and Life Support</h2>
				<h4>Providing a life-sustaining environment:</h4> The suits were engineered to create a self-contained, life-sustaining environment for the astronaut, supplying oxygen and regulating temperature and pressure [1, 2].
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Thermal regulation:</h4> The suits safeguarded astronauts from the extreme temperatures of the lunar surface, ranging from -250°F to +230°F [3]. This protection was achieved through a combination of layers, including an outer layer of Teflon-coated Beta cloth [1, 4].

				<br>
				<br>

				<h4>Impact and micrometeoroid protection:</h4> The suits shielded astronauts from potential impacts of micrometeoroids travelling at high speeds [5]. This protection was further enhanced by the extravehicular visor assembly worn over the pressure helmet, offering impact, micrometeoroid, and thermal protection [6].
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Radiation protection:</h4> The suits incorporated materials like Mylar to reflect solar and galactic radiation [7]. Multiple layers, including aluminized Kapton and Beta marquisette, contributed to minimising conductive heat gain or loss, ensuring thermal stability within the suit [8].
				<br>
				<br>

				<h2>Mobility and Functionality</h2>
				<h4>Maximum mobility:</h4> The Apollo lunar spacesuits were designed to facilitate ease of movement for the astronauts, allowing them to conduct their tasks effectively [1]. The suits were individually tailored for each astronaut, ensuring a comfortable fit [9].
				<br>
				<br>

				<h4>Flexibility under pressure:</h4> The suits were designed to remain flexible even when pressurised, allowing for a wide range of motion [1, 10]. Latex-dipped convolutes at the joints facilitated easier flexing, a feature further enhanced in later missions with innovations like the link-net design using Dacron and Teflon cords [11, 12].
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Dexterity:</h4> The gloves, a crucial component of the spacesuit, were carefully designed to provide both protection and sensitivity [13]. Gloves for the Apollo missions were custom-made using hand casts of each astronaut [14]. The fingertips of the gloves were made of silicone rubber to enhance sensitivity and grip, crucial for handling tools and conducting experiments on the lunar surface [15, 16].
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Additional Features</h2>
				<h4>Liquid cooling:</h4> The suits featured a liquid cooling garment made of nylon spandex with a network of PVC tubing [17]. This garment circulated cool water from the backpack, effectively removing excess body heat generated during physical activity [17].
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Emergency preparedness:</h4> The suits could be worn for up to 115 hours with the liquid cooling garment and even for 14 days in an unpressurized mode, offering a safety margin in case of emergencies [1].
				<br>
				<br>
				The suits were a complex assembly of advanced materials, many of which were not specifically developed for space exploration but were adapted for use in the Apollo program [18]. Their intricate design, combining protection, life support, and mobility, was a testament to the technological ingenuity of the time and played a critical role in the success of the Apollo lunar missions.</p>

			<h3>Neil Armstrong's Gloves</h3>
			<h2>What you should know</h2>			
			<p>

				The gloves in an astronaut's spacesuit play a critical role in enabling them to perform tasks safely and effectively in the harsh environment of space. Here are some key functions and design aspects of spacesuit gloves based on the sources you provided:</p>
				
				<h2>Protection:</h2>The gloves protect astronauts' hands from extreme temperatures that can range from -250°F to +230°F (-156.7°C to 110°C). [1]
				They shield against micrometeoroids travelling at high speeds. [2-4]
				The outer layer is designed to resist abrasion from sharp tools and the lunar/space environment. [4, 5]
				<br>
				<br>

				<h2>Pressure Maintenance:</h2>Like the spacesuit itself, the gloves are pressurised to maintain a life-sustaining environment for the astronaut's hands. [2, 6, 7]
				The pressure layer within the glove helps keep air inside the spacesuit. [7]
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Dexterity and Sensitivity:</h2>The design of the gloves aims to provide as much dexterity as possible for handling tools and equipment. [6]
				Special materials and features are incorporated to enhance sensitivity. For example:
				Silicone rubber fingertips were used in the Apollo gloves to provide extra sensitivity. [2, 4]
				Shark skin was used in experimental gloves for enhanced touch and grip. [4]
				Textured rubber was used in Russian Orlan gloves to improve grip. [8]
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Warmth:</h2>
				Given the extreme temperature fluctuations in space, maintaining warmth in the gloves is crucial. [9]
				Design features and materials are used to provide thermal insulation:
				The Apollo gloves included multiple layers of insulation, with alternating layers of Dacron sandwiched between aluminized Mylar. [10]
				Later designs incorporated heating elements within the glove fingers. [11]
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Evolution of Design:</h2>
				Over time, the design of spacesuit gloves has evolved significantly to improve comfort, flexibility, and functionality:
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Apollo era:</h4> Gloves were custom-made using plaster casts of each astronaut's hands. [12]
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Space Shuttle era:</h4> Hand casts were replaced by digital scans, and gloves were matched to a library of hand shapes and sizes. [13] This allowed for more standardized sizing while still aiming for a good fit.
				New materials like Chromel-R, shark skin, and Vectran were incorporated to improve protection, grip, and abrasion resistance. [4, 5]
				<br>
				<br>
				Comfort gloves made of silk were introduced to provide an extra layer of fabric between the astronaut's skin and the outer gloves. [13]
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Challenges in Glove Design:</h2>
				
				Despite ongoing advancements, spacesuit gloves remain the most limiting factor in the kind of work astronauts can perform in space. [14] Maintaining a balance between dexterity, protection, and pressure maintenance is a complex engineering challenge.
				
				The sources you provided highlight the intricate design and evolution of spacesuit gloves and their crucial role in protecting astronauts and enabling them to carry out tasks in the demanding environment of space.</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<h4>Sunshades:</h4> To manage varying light conditions, especially during spacewalks (extravehicular activities or EVAs), the visor assembly includes sunshades. The Apollo A7-L visor has three opaque sunshades – two on the sides and one in the centre – that can be raised and lowered independently to block direct sunlight. [1, 3]
					<br>
					<br>

					<h4>Pressure Maintenance:</h4>
					The visor assembly, working in conjunction with the pressure helmet, helps maintain the pressurised environment within the spacesuit that is essential for the astronaut's survival. [3]
					<br>
					<br>

					<h4>Example: The Apollo A7-L Extravehicular Visor Assembly</h4>

					The sources provide detailed information about the visor worn by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission. It exemplifies the multi-functionality of a spacesuit visor:
					<br>
					<br>

					The visor assembly was worn over the pressure helmet and attached with a latch during EVAs. [1, 3]

					<br>
					<br>
					It comprised a polycarbonate shell with two visors – one with a thermal control coating and the other with a gold optical coating – and two adjustable side sunshields. [1, 3]
					<br>
					<br>
					The sources highlight how the visor is a crucial component of a spacesuit, integrating various protective features and design elements to ensure the astronaut's safety, clear vision, and ability to operate effectively in the challenging conditions of space.</p>
